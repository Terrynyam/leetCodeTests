Clean code is about writing readable, maintainable, and efficient code that is easy to understand and extend.
It follows principles such as simplicity, clarity, and minimal complexity.
1. Meaningful Naming: Use descriptive and meaningful names for variables, functions, and classes.
2. Small Functions and Methods: Break complex tasks into smaller, self-contained functions and methods.
3. Avoid Magic Numbers: Use named constants instead of magic numbers in your code.
4. Use Comments Wisely: Comment your code clearly and concisely to explain its purpose and functionality.
5. Avoid Long Parameter Lists: Use parameter lists that are short and easy to understand.
6. Handle Exceptions Properly: Handle exceptions gracefully and provide clear error messages.
7. Use Proper Formatting and Indentation: Use consistent formatting and indentation to make your code easy to read.
8. Follow the DRY Principle (Don’t Repeat Yourself): Don’t repeat the same code or logic in multiple places.
9. Write Unit Tests: Write tests for your code to ensure it works as expected.
10.Follow SOLID Principles
11. Follow Java Conventions:
    Use standard naming conventions (e.g., camelCase for methods and variables, PascalCase for classes).
    Keep indentation consistent and avoid overly long lines (typically under 100 characters).

Key Characteristics of Clean Code:
--Readable and Understandable:

Code should be intuitive and easy to follow, even for someone unfamiliar with the project.
It should communicate its intent clearly without needing extensive comments.

--Maintainable:

Clean code is easy to modify and extend. It follows principles that reduce complexity and prevent errors when changes are made.

--Simple and Minimalistic:

Avoid unnecessary complexity. Simpler solutions are often better and easier to maintain.

--Consistent Style:

Follow a consistent coding style and conventions to make the code predictable and easier to read.

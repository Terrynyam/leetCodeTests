Suggestions for Improving a Class That Implements an Interface:
-----------------------------------------------------------------

1. Adhere to the Interfaceâ€™s Contract:
Ensure all methods are implemented correctly and fulfill the contract of the interface.
The class should provide meaningful implementations.

2. Use Default Methods (Java 8+):
If appropriate, move reusable logic to a default method in the interface to avoid duplicate
code across implementations.

3. Use Dependency Injection:
Inject dependencies (like services or utilities) instead of hardcoding them.
This improves testability and flexibility.

4. Use Composition Instead of Inheritance:
When a class implements an interface, it should use composition instead of inheritance.
This allows the class to have a more flexible and extensible design.
If the interface methods require complex behavior, delegate tasks to helper classes rather than
having a single class do everything.
Composition over inheritance is a design principle that suggests that a class should achieve
functionality by delegating tasks to other objects (composition) rather than inheriting from a
superclass. In the context of implementing interfaces, this principle can help keep classes modular,
maintainable, and flexible.



5. Ensure SOLID Principles:
Single Responsibility: The class should only do one thing related to the interface.
Open/Closed Principle: The class should be open for extension but closed for modification.
